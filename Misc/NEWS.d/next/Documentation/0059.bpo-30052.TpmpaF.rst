the link targets for :func:`bytes` and :func:`bytearray` are now their
respective type definitions, rather than the corresponding builtin function
entries. Use :ref:`bytes <func-bytes>` and :ref:`bytearray <func-bytearray>`
to reference the latter.

In order to ensure this and future cross-reference updates are applied
automatically, the daily documentation builds now disable the default output
caching features in Sphinx.
