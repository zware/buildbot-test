Remove own implementation for thread-local storage.

CPython has provided the own implementation for thread-local storage (TLS)
on Python/thread.c, it's used in the case which a platform has not supplied
native TLS.  However, currently all supported platforms (Windows and pthreads)
have provided native TLS and defined the Py_HAVE_NATIVE_TLS macro with
unconditional in any case.
